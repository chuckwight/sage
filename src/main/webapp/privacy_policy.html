	<h1>ChemVantage Sage Privacy Policy</h1>
      We protect users' privacy to the maximum extent that allows the site to function as designed.
      
      <h2>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h2>
        Except for people who contact us directly (e.g., to establish an account or provide feedback), we do not store any user PII. We do not process, collect or store any user credit card or financial information whatsoever. All subscription payments are made through a secure connection to <a href=https://paypal.com>PayPal</a>.
      
      <h2>Digital Tracking</h2>
		<p>Sage uses a single strictly necessary browser cookie to maintain the state of a user's session, but otherwise Sage does not use cookies, web analytics, web beacons, pixel tags or any other type of digital tracking devices. Sage does not store information about IP addresses, locations, or browser information of our users. Sage does not display any advertisements or enter into any service agreements with third party advertisers.</p>
        <p>Sage uses Google reCaptcha (version 3) to protect our site from fraud, spam and abuse. You must agree to the <a href=https://policies.google.com>Google Privacy and Terms Policies</a> to login to Sage.</p>
        <p>Sage also uses Google Ads to market our site and measure conversion rates. Google displays our ads on their search pages and may use cookies and/or device identifiers to serve ads based on past visits to this website.</p>          
	  
	  <h2>Data and Information Collected</h2>
        We keep a record of users' subscriptions and scores on each concept. All data and information transmitted to or from the user's browser are protected by TLS/SSL encryption while in transit, and all data are stored in encrypted form on Google Cloud Datastore servers while at rest. All user data are solely owned by the user and may be deleted upon request to <a href="mailto:admin@chemvantage.org">admin@chemvantage.org</a>.
       
	  <h2>How We Use Data and Information that We Collect</h2>
         We use scores, responses and user comments/feedback to improve the quality of individual question items in the site as well as site navigation and user experience. We also use timestamps to automatically delete user data after one year of inactivity.
      
      <h2>Information That We Share</h2>
         We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose user information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. Otherwise, we do not and will not share any user data or information with any third party.
