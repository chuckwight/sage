	<h1>ChemVantage Sage Privacy Policy</h1>
      We protect users' privacy to the maximum extent that allows the site to function as designed.
      
      <h2>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h2>
        Except for people who contact us directly (e.g., to establish an account or provide feedback), we do not store any user PII. We do not process, collect or store any user credit card or financial information whatsoever. All subscription payments are made through a secure connection to <a href=https://paypal.com>PayPal</a>.
      
      <h2>Digital Tracking</h2>
		We use a single session ID to maintain the state of a user's session, but otherwise we do not use browser cookies, web analytics, web beacons, pixel tags or any other type of digital tracking devices. We do not store information about IP addresses, locations, or browser information of our users. We do not display any advertisements or enter into any service agreements with third party advertisers.
                    
	  <h2>Data and Information Collected</h2>
        We keep a record of users' subscriptions and scores on each concept. All data and information transmitted to or from the user's browser are protected by TLS/SSL encryption while in transit, and all data are stored in encrypted form on Google Cloud Datastore servers while at rest. All user data are solely owned by the user and may be deleted upon request to <a href="mailto:admin@chemvantage.org">admin@chemvantage.org</a>.
       
	  <h2>How We Use Data and Information that We Collect</h2>
         We use scores, responses and user comments/feedback to improve the quality of individual question items in the site as well as site navigation and user experience. We also use timestamps to automatically delete user data after one year of inactivity.
      
      <h2>Information That We Share</h2>
         We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose user information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. Otherwise, we do not and will not share any user data or information with any third party.
                   
      <h2>Google reCAPTCHA</h2>
        We use the Google reCAPTCHA tool on our login page to detect bots and prevent spam and abuse. To start each session you must accept the Google reCAPTCHA Terms of Service and the Google API Terms of service.
